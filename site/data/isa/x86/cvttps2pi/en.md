summary: Convert With Truncation Packed Single Precision Floating-Point Values to Packed
---

## Description

Converts two packed single precision floating-point values in the source operand (second operand) to two packed signed doubleword integers in the destination operand (first operand). The source operand can be an XMM register or a 64-bit memory location. The destination operand is an MMX technology register. When the source operand is an XMM register, the two single precision floating-point values are contained in the low quadword of the register.

When a conversion is inexact, a truncated (round toward zero) result is returned. If a converted result is larger than the maximum signed doubleword integer, the floating-point invalid exception is raised, and if this exception is masked, the indefinite integer value 80000000H is returned.

This instruction causes a transition from x87 FPU to MMX technology operation (that is, the x87 FPU top-of-stack pointer is set to 0 and the x87 FPU tag word is set to all 0s [valid]). If this instruction is executed while an x87 FPU floating-point exception is pending, the exception is handled before the CVTTPS2PI instruction is executed.

In 64-bit mode, use of the REX.R prefix permits this instruction to access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15).

## Operation

```text
DEST[31:0] := Convert_Single_Precision_Floating_Point_To_Integer_Truncate(SRC[31:0]);
DEST[63:32] := Convert_Single_Precision_Floating_Point_To_Integer_Truncate(SRC[63:32]);
```

## Intel C/C++ compiler intrinsics

```c
CVTTPS2PI __m64 _mm_cvttps_pi32(__m128 a);
```

## SIMD Floating-Point Exceptions

Invalid, Precision.

## Other Exceptions

See Section 25.25.3, "Exception Conditions of Legacy SIMD Instructions Operating on MMX Registers" in the Intel(R) 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 3B.
