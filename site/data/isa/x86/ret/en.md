summary: Return From Procedure
---

## Description

Transfers program control to a return address located on the top of the stack. The address is usually placed on the stack by a CALL instruction, and the return is made to the instruction that follows the CALL instruction.

The optional source operand specifies the number of stack bytes to be released after the return address is popped; the default is none. This operand can be used to release parameters from the stack that were passed to the called procedure and are no longer needed. It must be used when the CALL instruction used to switch to a new procedure uses a call gate with a non-zero word count to access the new procedure. Here, the source operand for the RET instruction must specify the same number of bytes as is specified in the word count field of the call gate.

The RET instruction can be used to execute three different types of returns:

* Near return -- A return to a calling procedure within the current code segment (the segment currently pointed

to by the CS register), sometimes referred to as an intrasegment return.

* Far return -- A return to a calling procedure located in a different segment than the current code segment,

sometimes referred to as an intersegment return.

* Inter-privilege-level far return -- A far return to a different privilege level than that of the currently

executing program or procedure.

The inter-privilege-level return type can only be executed in protected mode. See the section titled "Calling Procedures Using Call and RET" in Chapter 6 of the Intel(R) 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 1, for detailed information on near, far, and inter-privilege-level returns.

When executing a near return, the processor pops the return instruction pointer (offset) from the top of the stack into the EIP register and begins program execution at the new instruction pointer. The CS register is unchanged.

When executing a far return, the processor pops the return instruction pointer from the top of the stack into the EIP register, then pops the segment selector from the top of the stack into the CS register. The processor then begins program execution in the new code segment at the new instruction pointer.

The mechanics of an inter-privilege-level far return are similar to an intersegment return, except that the processor examines the privilege levels and access rights of the code and stack segments being returned to determine if the control transfer is allowed to be made. The DS, ES, FS, and GS segment registers are cleared by the RET instruction during an inter-privilege-level return if they refer to segments that are not allowed to be accessed at the new privilege level. Since a stack switch also occurs on an inter-privilege level return, the ESP and SS registers are loaded from the stack.

If parameters are passed to the called procedure during an inter-privilege level call, the optional source operand must be used with the RET instruction to release the parameters on the return. Here, the parameters are released both from the called procedure's stack and the calling procedure's stack (that is, the stack being returned to).

In 64-bit mode, the default operation size of this instruction is the stack-address size, i.e., 64 bits. This applies to near returns, not far returns; the default operation size of far returns is 32 bits.

Refer to Chapter 6, "Procedure Calls, Interrupts, and Exceptions," and Chapter 18, "Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET)," in the Intel(R) 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 1, for CET details.

When FRED transitions are enabled, an execution of far RET that would change CPL causes a general-protection exception, as does an execution of far RET that would enter compatibility mode when CPL is 0.

Instruction ordering. Instructions following a far return may be fetched from memory before earlier instructions complete execution, but they will not execute (even speculatively) until all instructions prior to the far return have completed execution (the later instructions may execute before data stored by the earlier instructions have become globally visible).

Unlike near indirect CALL and near indirect JMP, the processor will not speculatively execute the next sequential instruction after a near RET unless that instruction is also the target of a jump or is a target in a branch predictor.

## Flags affected

None.

## Description

Rotates the bits of source operand right by the count value specified in imm8 without affecting arithmetic flags. The result is written to the destination operand. This instruction is not supported in real mode and virtual-8086 mode. The operand size is always 32 bits if not in 64-bit mode. In 64-bit mode operand size 64 requires VEX.W1. VEX.W1 is ignored in non-64-bit modes. An attempt to execute this instruction with VEX.L not equal to 0 will cause #UD.

## Operation

```text
IF (OperandSize = 32)

    y := imm8 AND 1FH;
    DEST := (SRC >> y) | (SRC << (32-y));
ELSEIF (OperandSize = 64)
    y := imm8 AND 3FH;
    DEST := (SRC >> y) | (SRC << (64-y));
FI;
```

## Flags affected

None.

## SIMD Floating-Point Exceptions

None.

## Other Exceptions
