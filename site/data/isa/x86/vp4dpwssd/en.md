summary: Dot Product of Signed Words With Dword Accumulation (4-Iterations)
---

## Description

This instruction computes 4 sequential register source-block dot-products of two signed word operands with doubleword accumulation; see Figure 8-1 below. The memory operand is sequentially selected in each of the four steps.

In the above box, the notation of "+3"' is used to denote that the instruction accesses 4 source registers based on that operand; sources are consecutive, start in a multiple of 4 boundary, and contain the encoded register operand.

This instruction supports memory fault suppression. The entire memory operand is loaded if any bit of the lowest 16-bits of the mask is set to 1 or if a "no masking" encoding is used.

The tuple type Tuple1_4X implies that four 32-bit elements (16 bytes) are referenced by the memory operation portion of this instruction.

NOTES: 1. For illustration purposes, one source-block dot product instance is shown out of the four.

## Operation

```text
src_reg_id is the 5 bit index of the vector register specified in the instruction as the src1 register.

VP4DPWSSD dest, src1, src2

(KL,VL) = (16,512)
N := 4

ORIGDEST := DEST
src_base := src_reg_id & ~ (N-1) // for src1 operand

FOR i := 0 to KL-1:

    IF k1[i] or *no writemask*:
         FOR m := 0 to N-1:
               t := SRC2.dword[m]
               p1dword := reg[src_base+m].word[2*i] * t.word[0]
               p2dword := reg[src_base+m].word[2*i+1] * t.word[1]
               DEST.dword[i] := DEST.dword[i] + p1dword + p2dword

    ELSE IF *zeroing*:
         DEST.dword[i] := 0

    ELSE
         DEST.dword[i] := ORIGDEST.dword[i]

DEST[MAX_VL-1:VL] := 0
```

## SIMD Floating-Point Exceptions

None.

## Other Exceptions

See Type E4; additionally:

```text
#UD               If the EVEX broadcast bit is set to 1.
```

```text
#UD               If the MODRM.mod = 0b11.
