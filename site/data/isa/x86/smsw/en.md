summary: Store Machine Status Word
---

## Description

Stores the machine status word (bits 0 through 15 of control register CR0) into the destination operand. The destination operand can be a general-purpose register or a memory location.

In non-64-bit modes, when the destination operand is a 32-bit register, the low-order 16 bits of register CR0 are copied into the low-order 16 bits of the register and the high-order 16 bits are undefined. When the destination operand is a memory location, the low-order 16 bits of register CR0 are written to memory as a 16-bit quantity, regardless of the operand size.

In 64-bit mode, the behavior of the SMSW instruction is defined by the following examples:

* SMSW r16 operand size 16, store CR0[15:0] in r16 * SMSW r32 operand size 32, zero-extend CR0[31:0], and store in r32 * SMSW r64 operand size 64, zero-extend CR0[63:0], and store in r64 * SMSW m16 operand size 16, store CR0[15:0] in m16 * SMSW m16 operand size 32, store CR0[15:0] in m16 (not m32) * SMSW m16 operands size 64, store CR0[15:0] in m16 (not m64)

SMSW is only useful in operating-system software. However, it is not a privileged instruction and can be used in application programs if CR4.UMIP = 0. It is provided for compatibility with the Intel 286 processor. Programs and procedures intended to run on IA-32 and Intel 64 processors beginning with the Intel386 processors should use the MOV CR instruction to load the machine status word. See "Changes to Instruction Behavior in VMX Non-Root Operation" in Chapter 27 of the Intel(R) 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 3C, for more information about the behavior of this instruction in VMX non-root operation.

## Operation

DEST := CR0[15:0];
