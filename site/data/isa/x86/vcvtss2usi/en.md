summary: Convert Scalar Single Precision Floating-Point Value to Unsigned Doubleword
---

## Description

Converts a single precision floating-point value in the source operand (the second operand) to an unsigned doubleword integer (or unsigned quadword integer if operand size is 64 bits) in the destination operand (the first operand). The source operand can be an XMM register or a memory location. The destination operand is a generalpurpose register. When the source operand is an XMM register, the single precision floating-point value is contained in the low doubleword of the register.

When a conversion is inexact, the value returned is rounded according to the rounding control bits in the MXCSR register or the embedded rounding control bits.

If a converted result exceeds the range limits of signed doubleword integer (in non-64-bit modes or 64-bit mode with REX.W/VEX.W/EVEX.W=0), the floating-point invalid exception is raised, and if this exception is masked, the integer value FFFFFFFFH is returned.

If a converted result exceeds the range limits of signed quadword integer (in 64-bit mode and REX.W/VEX.W/EVEX.W = 1), the floating-point invalid exception is raised, and if this exception is masked, the integer value FFFFFFFF_FFFFFFFFH is returned.

VEX.W1 and EVEX.W1 versions: promotes the instruction to produce 64-bit data in 64-bit mode.

Note: EVEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 1111b, otherwise instructions will #UD.

## Operation

```text
VCVTSS2USI (EVEX Encoded Version)
IF (SRC *is register*) AND (EVEX.b = 1)

    THEN
          SET_ROUNDING_MODE_FOR_THIS_INSTRUCTION(EVEX.RC);

    ELSE
          SET_ROUNDING_MODE_FOR_THIS_INSTRUCTION(MXCSR.RC);

FI;
IF 64-bit Mode and OperandSize = 64
THEN

    DEST[63:0] := Convert_Single_Precision_Floating_Point_To_UInteger(SRC[31:0]);
ELSE

    DEST[31:0] := Convert_Single_Precision_Floating_Point_To_UInteger(SRC[31:0]);
FI;
```

## Intel C/C++ compiler intrinsics

```c
VCVTSS2USI unsigned _mm_cvtss_u32( __m128 a);
VCVTSS2USI unsigned _mm_cvt_roundss_u32( __m128 a, int r);
VCVTSS2USI unsigned __int64 _mm_cvtss_u64( __m128 a);
VCVTSS2USI unsigned __int64 _mm_cvt_roundss_u64( __m128 a, int r);
```

## SIMD Floating-Point Exceptions

Invalid, Precision.

## Other Exceptions

EVEX-encoded instructions, see Table 2-50, "Type E3NF Class Exception Conditions."
